                <p>Mix dry ingredients together. You need all-purpose flour, natural unsweetened cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Do you remember the difference between natural cocoa powder and dutch-process cocoa powder? Use natural here.
                Beat wet ingredients together. You need butter, white sugar, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Room temperature butter and egg will mix more evenly into each other, creating a uniform texture among all the cookies. Additionally, both whip into a greater volume when at room temperature, producing a softer-crumbed cookie.
                Combine all ingredients, then add milk. 1 Tablespoon of milk smooths out the dough. And don’t forget to add the white chocolate chips! Looking for a double chocolate chip cookie recipe? Replace the white chocolate with regular chocolate chips.
                Chill the cookie dough in the refrigerator. The cookie dough is sticky and unmanageable, so chilling is necessary. I usually chill it overnight, but 3 hours is just enough. Chilled cookie dough is not only easier to handle and roll into balls, it also guarantees thicker cookies. See my 10 Tips to Prevent Cookies from Spreading.
                Roll cookie dough into balls. After chilling, roll the cookie dough into balls– a heaping 1.5 Tablespoons of dough per cookie.
                Bake. Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes. If the cookies aren’t really spreading by minute 9, remove them from the oven and lightly bang the baking sheet on the counter 2-3x. This helps initiate that spread. Return to the oven for a couple more minutes.

                <h4 class="heading-title text-center">Sugar</h4>
                <p>Make cookie dough. You only need 7-8 ingredients. With so little ingredients, it’s important that you follow the recipe closely. Creamed butter and sugar provide the base of the cookie dough. Egg is the cookie’s structure and vanilla extract adds flavor. I almost always add a touch of almond extract for additional flavor and highly recommend that you try it too! Flour is an obvious addition, baking powder adds lift, and salt balances the sweet. So many *little ingredients* doing *big jobs* to create a perfect cookie. By the way, I also make chocolate sugar cookies too!
                Divide in two pieces. Smaller sections of dough are easier to roll out.
                Roll out cookie dough. Roll it out to 1/4 inch thick or just under 1/4 inch thick. If you have difficulty evenly rolling out dough, try this adjustable rolling pin. Speaking from experience– it’s incredibly handy!
                Chill rolled out cookie dough. Without chilling, these cookie cutter sugar cookies won’t hold their shape. Chill the rolled out cookie dough for at least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days.
                Cut into shapes. If you need suggestions for cookie cutters, I love Ann Clark brand. (Not sponsored, just a genuine fan!) Some of my favorites include this heart set, dog bone, snowflake, snowman, leaf, and a pumpkin.
                Bake & cool. Depending on size, the cookies take about 12 minutes.

                <p>Note: click on times in the instructions to start a kitchen timer while cooking.Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
                In a medium bowl, cream together the softened butter, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended.
                Beat in the vanilla and eggs until light and creamy.
                Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside. Add in the Oreo crumbs.
                Add in the sifted ingredients on lowest speed setting until just blended.
                Stir in 1/3 of the Oreo chunks and refrigerate dough for 1 hour.
                Roll dough into 1 tablespoon sized ball and roll in remaining chunks then add to a cookie sheet about 3 inches apart (refrigerate the remaining cookie dough balls you've rolled while the first batch bakes).
                Bake for 13-15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are lightly browned.
                Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely and bake the remaining batches.</p>
